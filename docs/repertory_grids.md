# Bonus 1 - Requirements Study 

To complete bonus activity 1, 5 people were asked to complete repertory grids regarding their evaluation of car brands and attributes. Their perspectives were evaluated against the data provided to identify any gaps in our modeling techniques.

### Results 

### Commentary / Discussion 

During the collection of data, one of the suprising things I noted was that participants were heavily choosing subcategories of each of the fields to base their evaluation on. A broad category such as MPG, would be interpreted differently by each participant. For example, one person was comparing electric, hybrid and gas cars when filling out this question, while anouther was strictly evaluating how MPG translated into miles driven before fill up. The lesson learned here is that when working with human subjects, it is pertinent to be very explicit about the question being asked so there is no ambiguity about the validity of their answer. Overall, repertory grids were pleasant to work with, and provide a very data driven approach to gathering perception data that is easy to interpret and explore further.
